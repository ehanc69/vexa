## 🚀 Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Git

- Stable internet connection

### Step 1: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa
cd vexa
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

### Step 2: Set Up Whisper Service

```bash
cd whisper_service
cp .env.example .env
chmod +x start.sh
docker compose up -d
```

Check logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

### Step 3: Set Up Transcription Service

```bash
cd ../vexa-transcription-service
cp .env.example .env
# Set WHISPER_SERVICE_URL and WHISPER_API_TOKEN
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Set Up Engine Service

```bash
cd ../vexa-engine
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
# Optional clear existing transcripts
docker compose exec vexa-engine python clear_transcripts.py
```

### Step 5: Start Test Meeting API Calls Replay

```bash
cd ../vexa-testing-app
python register_test_user.py
python main.py
```

This will start sending API calls that simulate a meeting. Keep this terminal running for the duration of your test.

### Step 6: View Results (In a Separate Terminal)

While keeping the previous terminal with API calls running, open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd ../vexa-engine
docker compose exec vexa-engine python demo.py
```

### Step 7: Access Documentation and Dashboards

After all services are running, you can access:

- Transcription Service Swagger: [http://localhost:8008/docs](http://localhost:8008/docs)
- Engine Service Swagger: [http://localhost:8010/docs](http://localhost:8010/docs)
- Ray Model Deployment Dashboard: [http://localhost:8265/#/overview](http://localhost:8265/#/overview)

### Troubleshooting

- Logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Verify `.env` configurations
- Ensure GPU passthrough is correctly configured
